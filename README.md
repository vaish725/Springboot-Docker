# Springboot-Docker

Implementation of Java application and deployment of docker image of spring boot application within docker container.

Docker is a Linux container management toolkit with a “social” aspect, letting users publish container images and consume those published by others. A Docker image is a recipe for running a containerized process. In this implementation, we build one for a simple Spring boot application.

Docker helps you containerize your Java app — letting you bundle together your complete Spring application, runtime, configuration, and OS-level dependencies. This includes everything needed to ship a cross-platform, multi-architecture web application.
Docker uses a Dockerfile to specify each image’s “layers.” Each layer stores important changes stemming from the base image’s standard configuration. Create the following empty Dockerfile in your Spring Boot project.
Docker simplifies and accelerates your workflows by letting you freely innovate with your choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project. You can run your Spring Boot artifact directly within Docker containers. This is useful when you need to quickly create microservices.
